# Remote-Console

This is a (short? ._.) readme now I guess?

Well in short, this plugin allows staff members (well anyone with the required permission node) to connect to the server using a custom client.
This allows for reading console output, as well as chatting and running commands when the player is not online.
Permissions will be respected, displayNames will be respected if possible. Those will be updated when a player leaves.
If the player is also online at the time of the custom client sending a message/command, it will use the online player, if not it will use a clone.

Configuration is possible through the file plugins/remoteconsole/remoteconsole.properties, as well as through custom launch parameters of the spigot.jar:
To use those as launch parameters, add them to your launch script using --\<option\>.
LAUNCH PARAMETERS WILL ALWAYS OVERRIDE YOUR CONFIG! If something doesn't work as expected, check if you have put a launch parameter before complaining that an option doesn't work properly.

----- NOTE: LAUNCH PARAMETERS ARE STILL WIP, CONFIG FILE WORKS. THIS IS THE DEFAULT CONFIG -----
-rmc.datafolder="plugins/rmc" // Default data folder
-rmc.log=true                 // Enable logging
-rmc.log.path="latest.log"    // Path to the logfile. Will be stored in the data folder
-rmc.debug=0                  // Sets the debug output level to X (currently it will always print all outputs)
-rmc.noAuth=false             // Allows users to read console without authentication. Sending messages will still require authentication. HANDLE WITH CARE!
-rmc.respectPerms=true        // Enables permission respecting commands. If set to false, users can run anything with elevated permissions. HANDLE WITH CARE!
-rmc.LANOnly=false            // Will only allow connections from LAN IP ranges (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 127.0.0.1)
-rmc.VMOnly=false             // Will only allow connections from VM IP ranges (10.x.x.x, 127.0.0.1)
-rmc.localOnly=false          // Will only allow connections from local IPs (127.x.x.x) - These ones are overriding bottom to top. If localOnly is set, it will override the other two settings.
-rmc.noLocal=false            // Will disable the local join override permission. If not set, 127.0.0.1 will ALWAYS be able to connect
-rmc.localnoauth=true         // Will allow localhost connections to authenticate as any user without a password.
-rmc.whitelist=[]             // Will only allow connections from certain IP ranges. Allows the following style:
/\*
[] - all IPs are allowed to join
["192.168.1.1"] - allows only that IP to join
["192.168.1.\*',"192.168.[5-7].\*"] - allows addresses 192.168.1.\*, 192.168.5.\*, 192.168.6.\*, 192.168.7.\*
["192.168.[1,5-7].\*"] - a shorter representation of the previous one
["192.168.[1-3].\*","!192.168.2.46"] - allows 192.168.[1-3].* except exact address 192.168.2.46. Most right will override most left.

-rmc.port=9000                // Specifies the port to bind to.
-rmc.allowignauth=true        // Enables authentication through an ingame command when the user is online.
-rnc.ignauth.checkIP=true     // Compare the IPs and only allow ingame authentication if the IPs of the online user and the rmc user match.
-rmc.allowtoken=true          // Enables token authentication (tokens are invalidated after first use).

// PERMISSIONS - please note that the base permission is not granted by any wildcard but must be specifically specified. This is for security reasons.
